## üìñ Overview

**GorgiDev's UltraHardcore Fabric Mod** is a **server-side** Fabric 1.21.8 mod that transforms Minecraft hardcore into a true challenge.  

It enforces tougher gameplay by:  
- **Automatically removing armor** from all players.  
- **Disabling chat (client-side add-on required).**  
- Creating a stricter, unforgiving ultra-hardcore environment.  

This mod is lightweight, easy to install, and runs cleanly server-side without relying on mixins.
